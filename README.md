This one is taken as an anki-sync-server implementation in Rust
of  [ankicommunity/anki-sync-server](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server).
<br>
should work at least on Anki 2.1.40 and above,others needs testing. 

## Install 

### run from built binary package
Currently,only Windows are supported.download from releases.

| binary file | usage                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ankisyncctl | user account manage,eg add/delete user |
| ankisyncd   | anki sync server   |



### build from source
1. make sure Rust and its toolchains are installed.
follow [this link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) using rustup to install.
2. open terminal,clone github repo.
`git clone https://github.com/dobefore/anki-sync-server-rs.git `
3. run build command
`cargo build --release`
## Setting up Anki

#### Anki 2.1(install add from ankiweb)
Tools -> Add-ons

1. on add-on window,click `Get Add-ons` and fill in the textbox with the code  `358444159`

2. there,you get add-on `custom sync server redirector`,choose it.Then click `config`  below right

3. apply your server ip address 

#### AnkiDroid

Advanced â†’ Custom sync server

Unless you have set up a reverse proxy to handle encrypted connections, use `http` as the protocol. The port will be either the default, 27701, or whatever you have specified in `ankisyncd.conf` (or, if using a reverse proxy, whatever port you configured to accept the front-end connection).

Use the same base url for both the `Sync url` and the `Media sync url`, but append `/msync` to the `Media sync url`. Do **not** append `/sync` to the `Sync url`.

Even though the AnkiDroid interface will request an email address, this is not required; it will simply be the username you configured with `ankisyncctl.exe adduser`.

## Account Management

#### option1

enter into ankisyncd account management

`ankisyncd.exe U`

and then followning the instructions

#### option2

use separate command line tool `ankisyncctl.exe` 

ie:create user account

`ankisyncctl.exe adduser zhigufei password`

more operations can be found by query help

`ankisyncctl -h`

### TODO

- [ ] allow self-signed certificate used in https in Intranet environment

- [ ] error handle
- [ ] anki versions test
- [x]  automatically add user account into auth ab when account
  is not empty in Settings.toml
- [ ]  add shell script for  build from source on linux and windows
- [ ]  builds for Linux and MacOs

### REFERENCE
ankisyncd architecture or apis depend on [ankicommunity/anki-sync-server](https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server) and
[ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki).
Sync APIs are based on anki/rslib 2.1.46
