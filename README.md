## Setting up Anki

#### Anki 2.1(install add-on from ankiweb)
Tools -> Add-ons

1. on add-on window,click `Get Add-ons` and fill in the textbox with the code  `358444159`

2. there,you get add-on `custom sync server redirector`,choose it.Then click `config`  below right

3. apply your server ip address ,restart Anki

#### AnkiDroid

Advanced â†’ Custom sync server

Unless you have set up a reverse proxy to handle encrypted connections, use `http` as the protocol. The port will be either the default, 27701, or whatever you have specified in `Settings.toml` (or, if using a reverse proxy, whatever port you configured to accept the front-end connection).

Use the same base url for both the `Sync url` and the `Media sync url`, but append `/msync` to the `Media sync url`. Do **not** append `/sync` to the `Sync url`.

Even though the AnkiDroid interface will request an email address, this is not required; it will simply be the username you configured with `ankisyncd.exe user -a`.
#### encrypted HTTP connection
Due to Android policy change,some ankidroid versions need
https transportation.Ankisyncd allow embeded self-signed certicate verify
used in LAN environment.open `Settings.toml` with text
editor,modify following lines:
```
#make ssl_enable true
ssl_enable="false"
# put cert and key file path 
cert_file=""
key_file=""
```
## Account Management

#### use subcommand of ankisyncd

enter into ankisyncd account management
i.e.create user account

```
ankisyncctl.exe user -a xiaoshiyilang iampass
```

more subcommand see help `ankisyncctl.exe -h`

### ENV VAR Override
currently var `ANKISYNCD_ROOT`,as server working dir where
cover server data(collections),database(auth,session) and config file `Settings.toml`,is supported.
if /home/ankiserver is set as working dir,cmd would be `export ANKISYNCD_ROOT=/home/ankiserver` on linux,
default value would be current directory relavent to executable path.

### TODO

- [ ] error handle
- [ ]  builds for Linux and MacOS
- [ ]  fix incorrect log time (when running on cross-compiled
binary)
- [ ]  add github repo link to log info
- [ ] add username to log info
- [ ] wiki writing
