2. there,you get add-on `custom sync server redirector`,choose it.Then click `config`  below right

3. apply your server ip address ,restart Anki

#### AnkiDroid

Advanced â†’ Custom sync server

Unless you have set up a reverse proxy to handle encrypted connections, use `http` as the protocol. The port will be either the default, 27701, or whatever you have specified in `Settings.toml` (or, if using a reverse proxy, whatever port you configured to accept the front-end connection).

Use the same base url for both the `Sync url` and the `Media sync url`, but append `/msync` to the `Media sync url`. Do **not** append `/sync` to the `Sync url`.

Even though the AnkiDroid interface will request an email address, this is not required; it will simply be the username you configured with `ankisyncctl.exe adduser`.
#### encrypted HTTP connection
Due to Android policy change,some ankidroid versions need
https transportation.Ankisyncd allow embeded self-signed certicate verify
used in LAN environment.open `Settings.toml` with text
editor,modify following lines:
```
#make ssl_enable true
ssl_enable="false"
# put cert and key file path 
cert_file=""
key_file=""
```
## Account Management

#### option1

enter into ankisyncd account management

`ankisyncd.exe U`

and then follow the instructions

#### option2

use separate command line tool `ankisyncctl.exe` 

ie:create user account

```
ankisyncctl.exe adduser rumengling liqingzhao
```

more operations can be found by querying help

`ankisyncctl -h`
